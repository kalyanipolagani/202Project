Kalyani Polagani (010808356) -- Respect

I am a part of Project Group 11, Empty Coffee Cups.  We have taken five important values of Extreme Programming(XP) which are Simplicity, Respect, Communication, Feedback and Courage.
For our team project I have taken the XP value "Respect". And to maintain that we have given every team member an opportunity to express their ideas for project. All of us have come up with ideas of our own and discussed it together. We have finally opted for the idea which all of us liked and felt we could present it better. I have gone through the learning activities listed in CS Unplugged website. I liked the activity they showed for sorting algorithms. All of our teammates discussed our ideas and in the end came up with the idea to develop a game using sorting algorithms technique. We are going to create levels; each level can be played on one of the sorting algorithms available. We are planning to use Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort etc. algorithms. The level of complexity increases for each level. This is done by assigning an algorithm to each level based on its complexity. We are yet to assign roles for the project as in who is supposed to do what work. As for this week project work, we have set up a team GitHub account and waffle board. I have added issues in waffle board for this week and based on that I will update the google sheet for Kanban CFD. This way I can keep track of my projects progress. I have installed Greenfoot and Processing and practiced on it which is also part of lab1.  I have gone through the concepts of programming in Greenfoot and Processing. I have worked on both of them as a part of lab1. So now I think, I can start my project work comfortably in both of them.

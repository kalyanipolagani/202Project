Arshpreet Singh Bhatti (010819796) ---- Communication

Week 4 Journal Entry

My extreme programming value is communication. So, working on the same lines, I am making sure that there are updates from every team member everyday to the group that we have created on Whatsapp. I make sure that everybody knows what the other person is doing, even if it is only a basic idea of the big problem. I also make sure that team meetings are regularly scheduled throughout the week. Last week, one of our team members couldn't make it to the team meeting, so I made sure that she attended the meeting via Skype and was briefed about the updates happening during the meeting. 

I have started working on my part of the project. I have the algorithms ready to be turned into code. I am going to code in Greenfoot since I also have to add an animation factor to the whole learning experience and to the game later. I am also looking at how to actually make animations in greenfoot. 

I am going to add the algorithms in the github account of the team soon and proceed to the coding phase in greenfoot soon after.
